## Introduction

This project is a Python-based dashboard utilizing various powerful libraries to visualize and analyze CO2 emissions data. The following libraries have been utilized to create an interactive and informative dashboard:

- **Panel**: Panel is a high-level app and dashboarding solution for Python that allows developers to create interactive web apps and dashboards from various sources of data.

- **Hvplot**: Hvplot is a high-level plotting API built on top of Bokeh and Pandas that provides a quick and convenient way to generate interactive plots.

- **Pandas**: Pandas is a fast, powerful, and flexible open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It is extensively used for data wrangling and analysis in this project.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

- **Jupyter Lab**: Jupyter Lab is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is a great environment for interactive computing and supports Jupyter notebooks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains comprehensive data on CO2 emissions, population, GDP, and related metrics for different countries across various years. Here's a brief overview of the dataset columns related to CO2 emissions:

- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Year**: The year for which the data is recorded.
- **Population**: The population of the country in that year.
- **CO2 Emissions (Total)**: Total CO2 emissions for that year in metric tons.
- **CO2 Emissions per Capita**: CO2 emissions per capita, representing the average emissions per person in metric tons.

The dataset offers valuable insights into the trends and patterns of CO2 emissions globally, allowing for in-depth analysis and visualization of the environmental impact of different countries over time.

For a more detailed understanding of the dataset and its structure, please refer to the dataset documentation.
